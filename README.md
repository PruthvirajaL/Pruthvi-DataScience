# DATA SCIENCE

This project is for learning purpose created under my sole response for beginners as well as for the intermediate data science learners. Data Science comprises of different tools such as 
* Data Extraction or Data Loading or Data Formatting or Data Construction or Data dowloading and saving from remote data base servers.
* Data Preprocessing: Data should be processed before doing the actual work on it because it's initial state is considered as raw data and processed data is known as useful data. 
* Data Analysis: To analyse the data we can use many tools like Python(programming tools), R, SAS and tableau(visually analyzing tool)
* Data Visualization: We can use Tableau as the visualizing tool or Microsoft Power BI or R-for data analysis. 
* Data Correction and uploading: To use data in dirrerent use cases the data has to be corrected and updated with the different techniques. 

My goal in this Pruthvi-DataScience is to introduce Python tools used in data science or data analysis. 

## Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the code files of this project you need to dowload and install these products in your local machine(Desktop or Laptop). 

* Python: Available at [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org)
* Anaconda 
* IPython and Jupyter
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy 
If you download anaconda distribution softwate available at [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) , you no need to download the other Python tools neccessary for data science. 

### Installing

After dowloading the packages on windows (For MacOS and Linux flatforms please watch how to download and setup anaconda in the official Anconda and Python Websites) try installing with the instructions displayed on the installation wizard. For more information on how to download and install you may [Anaconda Installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) . You can learn Python on web at [Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) . 

## Running the tests

I have written the codes both in anaconda Jupyter notebook and Python Shell script format. You just open the file in a right environment. After launching the anaconda navigator you find Jupyter notebook as well as Spyder IDE, open the Jupyter files with ".ipynb" extion in jupyter notebook and files with ".py" extention in Spyder IDE or you may also open ".py" extention files in Python IDE environment but you can't open jupyter notebook files in this envirnment. 

## Contributing

Please follow the project carefully as it is a learning purpose project, if anybody wants to contribute for this, it is most welcome. But before contributing please rise an issue to go further.  

## Versioning

Since the project is based on DVCS, you can download or clone the whole project and make changes. After making the changes push it back with the renamed file format like "(origional file name_(your-name)_(modified status as mod1 or mod2 etc.) " for the existing file and please don't delete the original file of the project until it reaches the final stage.

## Acknowledgments 

I here by acknowledge that the work is purely for the learning purpose, hence the data set downloaded are from the public domain sites any one can use them education purpose and not for the commercial purpose. If you want to use the data set for commerical purpose please visit the data set sites from where I've downloaded the same. The link for each data set is provided in DataSourseLinks file. Further:

* If you feel that the code was used already, please let me know it whather the code is open soursed or not. 
* Inspire the work and inpsire others with confidence. 
* Let us put our hands together to gain and explore the knowledge. 
* Thanks for all in advance. Happy learning.
